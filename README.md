# Example for SARS integration

SARS is short for:

- **S** tarling
- **A** way3D
- **R** obotlegs 2
- **S** ignalCommandMap extension

SARS library can be found [here](https://github.com/Vj3k0/robotlegs-extensions-SARS).

## TODO

- Write usage instructions
- Write tutorial explanation

## Overview

This example will try to provide example for:

- using Signals to communicate with Robotlegs framework *(since Starling uses its own event system)*
- using Starling framework to present 2D elements in application
- using Away3D 4 framework to present 3D elements in application
- interchanging Starling and Away3D views

Common usage for this integration would be when you require to have application which will have 3D scene and objects on it, but 2D menu, info screens, etc.

## Usage instructions

***TODO: Add instructions***

## How it works
